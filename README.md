# ListWindowsFiles

Python script to list all files in a folder and show them in a temporary text document (using Notepad), which you can save, copy, or discard.

When run, a text document is created in /temp, looking like this: 

```
├── favicon.ico
├── list_all_files_in_a_folder.exe
└── list_all_files_in_a_folder.py
```

### Portable executable

Feel free to use [one of these methods](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/two-simple-methods-to-convert-a-python-file-to-an-exe-file) to create an executable that you can then run in any folder by double-clicking on it rather than via CLI.
